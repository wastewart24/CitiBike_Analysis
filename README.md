# CitiBike_Analysis
### Overview
The goal of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. An analysis and proposal will be created using data from the Citi Bike program in New York City in August 2019. This data was obtained from the CitiBike program website, scrubbed and organized using Pandas, and visualized in Tableau Public.

#### Ride Analysis by Weekday:

Most of the rides during the weekday occured during rush hours when people were going to and from work. In the morning it peaked between 7-9am and 5-7pm at night. There were not many rides taken during the night rush hour on Wednesday which is something worth looking further into. On the weekends, the number of rides increased throughout the whole day with Saturday seeing slightly higher numbers than Sunday.

### Summary

The majority of riders and subscribers are male, most of the rides are taken during rush hours on the weekdays, and the majority of the rides don't last longer than 30 minutes. In order to gather more information from the data for future analysis, a cost analysis should be done to compare between subscribers and non-subscribers. It should showcase how much money subscribers save from taking rides in order to market to non-subscribers why they should join the program. Another analysis could be done on the comparison between CitiBike service and a rideshare service to show the comparisons and inform customers about the cost benefits of taking a CitiBike service in most cases when they need to travel a short distance.
